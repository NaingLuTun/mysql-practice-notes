Database Notes

// command keywords in mySQL are not case sensitive so you can write it in any way.

example - create or Create or CREATE (any way really)

// you also have to put a semicolon (;) at the end of each SQL statements.


// To create a database
CREATE DATABASE myDataBaseName;

// To use a database
USE myDataBaseName;

// To drop (delete) a database
DROP DATABASE myDataBaseName;

// To make a database read only 
(meaning you can't modify or drop the database but you can still get datas from it)
ALTER DATABASE myDataBaseName READ ONLY = 1;

// To disable read only
ALTER DATABASE myDataBaseName READ ONLY = 0;
